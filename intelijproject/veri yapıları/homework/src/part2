Since queues operate on a first-in first-out basis,
they are more suitable for a hospital environment
because the first patient to arrive is the first to
be examined; this is the most normal situation. However,
if we were to use stacks, they would operate on a last-in
last-out basis, which would not be very suitable for a
hospital environment and would lead to unfairness.
Therefore, using queues is more logical for our project.

Comparing the time complexities of queue and stack, the
insertion part is O(1) for both because the queue inserts
the newly added data to the beginning, while the stack
inserts it to the beginning; both of these situations are O(1).
In element deletion, the queue deletes the last element of the list,
meaning the first one added, while the stack deletes the last element
added, meaning the first one added. However, both are O(1).
Printing the list is O(n) for both because each element in the list
is iterated through one by one.Both are equivalent in terms of time
complexities, but logically, the queue is more useful for this part.
