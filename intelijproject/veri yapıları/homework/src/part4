The time complexity of priority queue is O(1) because
all we do is add or delete elements, and we do this with
enqueu and dequeue. Therefore, we add to the beginning
and delete to the end.In the sorting algorithm, the time
complexity is O(n*n) because the algorithm contains nested
do-while and while loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*n).
Since we use hashmap, our time complexity for finding the
patient is O(1) and the patient is found instantly because
of the hashmap.

The bubble sort we use separates patients into emergency and
normal categories, but if we used heap sort, the most serious
cases would always be at the top. The time complexity of bubble
sort for adding and removing patients is O(n*n), while heap sort's
is O(logn). In short, heap sort is a more professional solution for
lists where not many patients are added.

My explanation about tasks:

Generally, when creating linked list queues and heaps, I didn't add
much print in the HospitalSystem section to create the distributions
that the system needs to write. Otherwise, I tried to do everything
simply as requested. You can decide whether to use the bubble sort
algorithm last. I used the isEmpty function as seen in the slides;
I didn't use get and set methods in some parts, which would have been
better, but I didn't use them because they weren't specifically requested.
Overall, in terms of performance, perhaps using heap instead of bubble sort
at the end would have been more beneficial, but I preferred that
option because it was also available in the options you provided.
In addition to these, I used a hashing algorithm as requested,
which allowed us to quickly find patients. I also used milliseconds
for the times; perhaps date format would have been more elegant, but I
understood that the assignment required milliseconds, so I used that. I
deliberately didn't use `size` in the stack because an operation involving
`size` wasn't required. That's all for the assignment, thank you.
