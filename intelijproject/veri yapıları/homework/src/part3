First of all, it's very useful for these operations because all
operations on the stack are performed in the sum. We do both
additions and subtractions with the sum. It's also very suitable
for hospital discharge procedures because of the logic behind them,
the last-in, first-out principle.

If we used a queue, we would encounter problems due to the first-in,
first-out principle; that is, instead of seeing a newly discharged patient,
we would see a patient who was discharged a long time ago. Therefore, using
a queue would be useless. While the stack and queue methods are O(1) for
insertion and deletion, their print methods are also O(n) because they iterate
through the entire list when printing. In short, although the time complexities
are the same, the stack is more useful here due to its logical suitability.
