First, let's talk about big OH. The addPatient method is found to be
O(1) because I add patients to the end of the list, so big OH is found
to be 1. In the removePatient method, because it has a while loop, big
OH is found to be O(n). Similarly, it is the same in findPatient; it
needs to iterate through the entire list to find the patient, so its
big OH is also O(n).

If we compare the time complexities of these methods in LinkedList and
ArrayList, in array list, addPatient is O(n) because it needs to increase
the size of the list, while LinkedList is O(1). For the removePatient method,
both come out as O(n) at worst, and O(1) at best. However, LinkedList might
be more advantageous because it doesn't need to change the size. For findPatient
,both are O(n) because it checks each element individually. Both are preferable
for this method.
